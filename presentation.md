## Operation Tiger Briefing



## Hello Abraham Division



## Recently, extremely sensitive hardware has been stolen from MI6.



## However, we have intercepted transmissions it's being stored.



## MI6 agents are in the field who are following a specific protocol on how to retrieve this hardware.



### The Protocol:
- From the website `http://bit.ly/1zxWT7s`, retrieve a set of phone numbers.
	- Text each phone number with an arbitrary message.
- The number will respond with what kind of food they would like
	- Respond with the code `XC847`
- The number will then respond with a fragment of the address that points to the location for the stolen hardware.



### The Protocol Details
On the website `http://bit.ly/1zxWT7s`, phone numbers are represented in the comments section by the usernames of the commentor.



### For example:

The username 

`Tandy5193821029`

Represents the phone number 

`5193821029`




### The Problem
The phone numbers reserved for this were compromised. A new system to do this must be created.



### Your Mission
should you choose to accept, is to allocate a new set of phone numbers that allow the agents to follow the protocol.



## Do You Accept?

Agents are going to check `http://bit.ly/1zxWT7s` and are expecting to retrieve the phone numbers from the comments section.

### Step 3

Now under the protocol, in 30 minutes, agents will text that phone number and will be expecting to recieve the response of a restaurant asking:

```
"What kind of food would you like to order today?"
```

Agents who do this in 30 minutes who do not recieve this response, they will think something is wrong and will abort the mission.
